# CopyPath
Simple tool to copy file/directory path from the Windows context menu (see figure below).
The tool can be installed by unpacking it to the installation directory. Then run the command:
```
java -jar CopyPath.jar -i
```
If the path changes, then just executed the command again.
Now you should see the tool in the context menu.
If you want to remove the tool, use the argument `-u` like follows:
```
java -jar CopyPath.jar -u
```
